# üñºÔ∏è Image Compression using JPEG and Wavelet Techniques

This project performs **Image Compression** using two prominent methods: **JPEG (DCT-based)** and **Wavelet Transform (JPEG2000-like)**. It evaluates quality using **PSNR**, **SSIM**, and **compression ratio**, with visual comparisons to highlight performance trade-offs.

## üìå Project Overview

### Objectives:
- Load and compress images using JPEG (DCT) and Wavelet techniques
- Reconstruct images from compressed data
- Evaluate image quality using PSNR and SSIM
- Calculate actual compression ratio from file sizes
- Visualize original vs. reconstructed images

---

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (for image handling)
- PyWavelets (for wavelet compression)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- scikit-image (for PSNR & SSIM evaluation)

---

## üß™ Key Steps in the Compression Process

1. **Image Loading**
   - Reads input image and detects color mode

2. **JPEG Compression**
   - Uses OpenCV's JPEG encoder with configurable quality
   - Decodes the image back to original dimensions

3. **Wavelet Compression**
   - Applies multilevel wavelet decomposition (`bior3.3`)
   - Reconstructs image using inverse wavelet transform

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Calculates **PSNR** (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
   - Calculates **SSIM** (Structural Similarity Index)
   - Computes **compression ratio** based on file sizes

5. **Visualization**
   - Displays side-by-side comparison of original vs compressed images

## üìå Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comparative analysis of **JPEG** and **Wavelet** image compression methods.  
By evaluating **PSNR**, **SSIM**, and **compression ratio**, it highlights the trade-offs between **visual quality** and **file size**, helping guide the choice of technique in real-world applications like **storage**, **transmission**, and **multimedia systems**.
